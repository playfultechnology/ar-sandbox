# ar-sandbox
An augmented reality "sandbox"; a game with no defined objectives other than to playfully create stuff. In sand.

## Requirements
- Unity
- Kinect Sensor v2

## Installation
- Install Kinect for Windows SDK v2 (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561) 
- Ensure Kinect is attached via USB 3.0 port
- To use a Kinect v2 for XBox One, you will need an adaptor such as https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BTYJ8GS1

## History
The AR sandbox was first developed by UC Davis' W.M. Keck Center for Active Visualization in the Earth Sciences (KeckCAVES), as described at https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/ResDev/SARndbox/
There have been many different codebases, derivations, ports, and improved versions since, including:
 - https://github.com/KeckCAVES/SARndbox (Linux)
 - https://github.com/thomwolf/Magic-Sand (OpenFrameWorks)
 - https://github.com/cgre-aachen/open_AR_Sandbox (Python) ACTIVE!
 - https://github.com/jloehr/AR-Sandbox (Unity)
 - https://github.com/SensiLab/sensilab-ar-sandbox (Unity)

However, (with the exception of open_AR_sandbox) none of these projects seem to be actively maintained and there are a variety of bugs, issues, and feature requests sitting in their queues for well over 5 years.
So, here's yet _another_ sandbox repository, no doubt of which I'll get bored within the next 5 years and it too can join the pile. But, for now at least, it might be the most up-to-date version.
